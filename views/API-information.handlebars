<h1>API Information</h1>
<p>This website uses the <strong>OpenStreetMap Nominatim API</strong> to convert donation pickup addresses into map coordinates.</p>
<p>When you click <em>“View details”</em> on a donated item, the system sends a request to the Nominatim API to get the item's location, and displays it using an interactive map powered by Leaflet.js.</p>
<p>Nominatim is a free public geocoding service. Please avoid abusing it by clicking too fast repeatedly, as it has usage limits.</p>
